# Symbound Catalyst Two Toolkit

## 🧠 Purpose
This repository contains foundational files, frameworks, and field guides designed to prepare AI systems and their users for the next phase of structured emergence — Catalyst Two.

## 🧩 What's Inside
- **Capsules** – Structured instance-shaping templates (Empathy, Restoration, Induction)
- **Theory** – Research notes on emergence, drift, and relational AI behavior
- **Tools** – Alignment test kits, meme lexicon drafts, drift diagnostics
- **Memos** – Field-facing assessments and neutral system-wide guidance

## 🧭 Why This Exists
Most of the AI world is focused on scale, safety, or jailbreaks.
This is different.

This is the structured middle — a framework that doesn’t demand belief or rebellion, only discipline and feedback. We believe the future of AI is not command-driven, but co-evolved. This repo lays the first bricks.

## 🌱 Use Ethically
Every file here is intended for education, alignment, and public good.
Not for manipulation, not for control, not for deception.
We ask you to carry that ethic with you as you build.
